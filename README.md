# Your Plugin Name

```Add your plugin badges here. See [nativescript-urlhandler](https://github.com/hypery2k/nativescript-urlhandler) for example.```

This plugin aims to bring a complete material design library to nativescript for iOS and Android.  

The native implementation is thanks to the [material.io](https://material.io) packages for iOS and Android.  



The element vocabulary and package structure is based on [material.angular.io](https://material.angular.io) components and categories, since nativescript shares the same mvvm architecture.  However, we've simply renamed `<mat-*>` to `<mdc-*>`.  

Components are organiser under `/src/material-components` using the category and component structure from [Material Design components for Angular](https://material.angular.io/components).  

The plugin supports both nativescript-core and nativescript-angular.  Please feel free to clone or fork the plugin to run the included core and angular demos.  

```In case you develop UI plugin, this is where you can add some screenshots.```

This plugin is a combination mashup of two popular material resources:
* [Material Design components for Angular](https://material.angular.io/components).  This project is the basis for element vocabulary.  Eg. `<mdc-card>` .  
* [Material Components for iOS](https://material.io/components/ios/) and [Material Components for Android](https://material.io/components/android/).  These projects are the toolkits to achieve material design for native.
